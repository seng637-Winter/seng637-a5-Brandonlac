# Introduction

This report outlines the use of a reliability assessment tool and conduct a series of tests using provided data. The report comprises two main methods of reliability assessment: Reliability Growth Testing and the use of a Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). These methodologies are designed to teach students the practical aspects of measuring and enhancing the reliability of software systems through empirical data analysis.

The subsequent sections of this report will outline the objectives, testing tools, procedures, and evaluation criteria for both reliability growth testing and reliability assessment using RDC, insights into the failure dynamics of software systems and the practical applications of theoretical models in real-world scenarios.
